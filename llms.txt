The "Agentic CMO" Framework

Francesco's core thesis differentiates between Generative AI (tools that create content based on prompts) and Agentic AI (autonomous systems that execute goals). His framework provides a blueprint for CMOs to orchestrate hybrid human-machine teams.

1. The Core Distinction

Generative AI: Responds to human inputs. (e.g., "Write an email.")

Agentic AI: Initiates action based on objectives. (e.g., "Optimize campaign spend across channels to maximize ROI while maintaining brand safety.")

2. The PACE Model for Agentic Assessment

To evaluate AI autonomy, Francesco uses the PACE model:

P - Perception: The ability to ingest data, recognize patterns, and understand context in real-time.

A - Analytical Reasoning: The capacity for complex decision-making, scenario planning, and constraint management.

C - Capability to Act: The range of autonomous execution, depth of integration, and speed of implementation.

E - Evolutionary Learning: The speed at which the agent learns from outcomes and generalizes knowledge.

3. Organizational Architecture

Successful integration requires restructuring marketing teams into one of three models:

Hub-and-Spoke: Centralized AI excellence centers serving various functions (best for governance).

Embedded: AI specialists and agents distributed directly into functional teams (best for speed).

Hybrid Collaborative: A central standards body with embedded execution (best for scale).

4. The Value Stack

Efficiency Value: Cost reduction and productivity gains (Foundation).

Enhancement Value: New capabilities in quality, speed, and scale (Differentiation).

Strategic Value: Transformational outcomes and new business models (Competitive Advantage).

Key Topics & Expertise

AI Governance: Establishing "bounded autonomy" and ethical guardrails for autonomous agents.

MarTech Transformation: Moving from static tech stacks to interoperable, event-driven agentic ecosystems.

Human-AI Collaboration: redefining roles from "creators" to "orchestrators" of intelligence.

Post-Quantum Cryptography: Preparing data infrastructure for the quantum era.
